Voron Bed Fans Deflector

I love Ellis's Belt Fan mod (https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Ellis/Bed_Fans) but found that it was realy heating up the back of my my 250mm printer, so I made these deflectors to redirect the heat upwords rather then straight back.

NOTE:
I designed them to have a bit of clearance on eather side for testing, so if you want them a bit longer you can always scale it in the slicer.

I printed mine with 5 layers and honey comb infill no top or botom.

This is just work in progress, Enjoy.

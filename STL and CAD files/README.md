I only designed the 1 side, and mirrored it in the slicer to get the other side.

I wanted to leave a gap from between the bed frame to let some heat travel down the aluminum, i figured this would help with heat soaking a bit.

If you don't want the gap you'll have to bump up the width in the slicer.
